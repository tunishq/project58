            I read books because books give you lots of information, can entertain you, and they can be a good thing to read when you are bored. Books are an important aspect of our learning experience. Books are rich repositories of knowledge. We find books in various forms around us from magazines to novels to self-help and academic books. They have managed to create a genre for just the needs of every individual.
